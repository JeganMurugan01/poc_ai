  Measles:
    "Measles is caused by the measles virus, which is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing. Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis). A characteristic rash develops about 3-5 days after symptoms begin, starting on the face and spreading downward to the rest of the body. Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may appear inside the mouth before the rash. There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles; care is supportive to relieve symptoms. Over-the-counter medications can help reduce fever and manage pain. Vitamin A supplements are sometimes given to children, especially in developing countries, to reduce the severity of the disease. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles. Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems. Herd immunity through vaccination is critical to prevent outbreaks.",
