      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Causes:</h3>
      <p class="description-text">
        Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV). It's highly contagious and spreads through direct contact with the rash, or through respiratory droplets from coughs or sneezes.
      </p>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Symptoms:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Initial symptoms include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, and headache.</li>
        <li>This is followed by a red, itchy rash that turns into fluid-filled blisters and then scabs over.</li>
        <li>The rash often starts on the face, chest, and back before spreading to the rest of the body.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Treatment:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Most cases are mild and can be managed at home with rest, hydration, and over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen (not aspirin due to the risk of Reyeâ€™s syndrome).</li>
        <li>Calamine lotion and oatmeal baths can help soothe itching.</li>
        <li>Antiviral medications like acyclovir may be prescribed for severe cases or for people at high risk of complications, such as pregnant women, newborns, and those with weakened immune systems.</li>
        <li>The chickenpox vaccine is highly effective in preventing the disease.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Other Relevant Details:</h3>
      <p class="description-text">
        Chickenpox usually lasts about 5 to 10 days. Once someone has had chickenpox, they are typically immune for life, though the virus can reactivate later in life as shingles.

        Measles is caused by the measles virus, which is highly contagious and spreads through respiratory droplets from coughing and sneezing.
      </p>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Symptoms:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Early symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, and red, watery eyes (conjunctivitis).</li>
        <li>A characteristic rash develops about 3-5 days after symptoms begin, starting on the face and spreading downward to the rest of the body.</li>
        <li>Small white spots known as Koplik's spots may appear inside the mouth before the rash.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Treatment:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>There is no specific antiviral treatment for measles; care is supportive to relieve symptoms.</li>
        <li>Over-the-counter medications can help reduce fever and manage pain.</li>
        <li>Vitamin A supplements are sometimes given to children, especially in developing countries, to reduce the severity of the disease.</li>
        <li>The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine is highly effective in preventing measles.</li>

        Measles can lead to serious complications, including pneumonia, encephalitis, and death, especially in young children, pregnant women, and people with weakened immune systems.
        Herd immunity through vaccination is critical to prevent outbreaks.

      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Causes:</h3>
      <p class="description-text">
        Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin due to the loss of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. The exact cause is unknown, but it is believed to be an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks and destroys the melanocytes.
      </p>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Symptoms:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Depigmented, milky-white patches of skin appear on various parts of the body, often symmetrically.</li>
        <li>The patches can occur anywhere but are most common on the face, hands, and areas around body openings.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Treatment:</h3>
      <ul class="description-list">
        <li>Treatments include topical corticosteroids, calcineurin inhibitors, and light therapy (e.g., PUVA or narrowband UVB) to help restore some skin color.</li>
        <li>Depigmentation therapy is an option for widespread vitiligo to even out skin tone by lightening unaffected areas.</li>
        <li>Cosmetic options like makeup or self-tanners can help cover up the patches.</li>
        <li>Newer treatments, such as Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, are under investigation.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="description-subtitle">Other Relevant Details:</h3>
      <p class="description-text">
        Vitiligo is not contagious or life-threatening but can have significant psychological effects due to its impact on appearance. The progression of the disease is unpredictable, and patches may spread, remain stable, or even repigment over time.
